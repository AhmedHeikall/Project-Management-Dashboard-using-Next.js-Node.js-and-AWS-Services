## introduction

building a Project Management Dashboard application using a combination of popular technologies and services.

We start by setting up the frontend with Next.js, integrating Tailwind CSS for styling and Material UI Data Grid to handle complex data presentations. We'll use Redux Toolkit for state management and Redux Toolkit Query for effective data fetching.

The backend architecture is built on Node.js, utilizing Express for server-side logic. We'll manage our database with PostgreSQL, interfaced through Prisma, and monitored using PgAdmin. We explore AWS services extensively, detailing the setup and integration of AWS Lambda for serverless computing and AWS Cognito for user authentication and management.
